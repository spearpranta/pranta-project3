				<h1><u><u>Marco Reus</u></u></h1>
				<p>Marco Reus (German pronunciation: [ˈmaʁkoː ˈʁɔʏs] ( listen); born 31 May 1989[1]) is a German professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder, winger or striker for German club Borussia Dortmund and the Germany national team. Reus is known for his versatility, speed and technique.[3]

Reus spent his youth career at Borussia Dortmund , prior to leaving for Rot Weiss Ahlen. He has played for three clubs in his senior career, most notably—and with the most influence—in Borussia Mönchengladbach of the Bundesliga.[4] Reus plays primarily as a left attacker for BVB; however, he is capable of playing on the right also and through the middle, due to his ability to closely control the ball with both feet.[citation needed] 2012 was his most successful season when, scoring 18 and assisting eight, he helped Borussia Mönchengladbach secure a place in the following season's UEFA Champions League. Reus agreed a move to his home club Borussia Dortmund at the end of that season. Reus wears the number 11 shirt for Dortmund.

With Dortmund, Reus won the 2013 DFL-Supercup. Reus was the Footballer of the Year in Germany in 2012 and was on the UEFA Team of the Year in 2013. Franz Beckenbauer spoke about Reus, along with Mario Götze, saying, "...as a classic duo there is nobody better than the prolific Reus and Götze."[5] In 2013, Reus was ranked as the fourth best footballer in Europe by Bloomberg.[6]

				<h2><u><u>Borussia Dortmund</u></u></h2>
				<p>On 4 January 2012, Reus signed with his former club Borussia Dortmund for a transfer fee of €17.1 million on a five-year deal that will keep him at the club until July 2017. He spoke about his transfer saying, "I've made the decision to take the next step forward in the coming season. I'd like to play for a club who can challenge for the league title and guarantee me Champions League football. I see this chance in Dortmund."[13] Reus officially re-joined Dortmund on 1 July 2012.[14] In Reus' Bundesliga debut with Dortmund on 24 August, he scored a goal as his new side completed a 2–1 win over Werder Bremen.[15] On 29 September, Reus scored two goals for Dortmund in a 5–0 rout of his former club Borussia Mönchengladbach, pushing the champions to the top of the Bundesliga table through six games.[16]</p>
